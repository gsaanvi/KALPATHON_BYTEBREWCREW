## Problem Statement

What software solutions could help users maintain healthier and more intentional screen time?
In an increasingly digital world, maintaining healthy and intentional screen time is a significant challenge, especially for young adults. Excessive screen time can lead to decreased productivity, poor mental health, and disrupted sleep patterns.

## Our Idea (Screen Time Tracker with unique reward system)

We are developing a web application that helps users track their screen time while encouraging healthier habits through a unique point reward system. Key features include:

- **User  Authentication**: Secure login for personalized tracking.
- **Screen Time Tracking**: Monitor time spent on various websites.
- **Weekly Goals and Stats**: Set goals and view progress.
- **Reward System**: Earn green points for visiting educational sites and receive red points for accessing distracting sites. Users can redeem rewards based on their accumulated green points.

This project is inspired by our personal experiences as young adults facing screen time challenges, aiming to create a solution that resonates with others.
